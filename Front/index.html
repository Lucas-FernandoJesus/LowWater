                The company LW emerged from the determination of a single individual who recalled their previous work during college and, over time, made it their goal to improve and monetize their second semester's final project.
            </p>
            <p class="paragrafos">
                This person is none other than Lucas Fernando (_Don_Clan), our main and only developer. After realizing his financial situation, he decided that it was time to achieve something that would change his career in the technology field.
            </p>
            <p class="paragrafos">
                After all this, our developer started a routine of dedicating at least one to two hours per day to work on his project, which we now know as LOW WATER.
                During the project development, he thought about seeking the assistance of his former college professor, Val√©rio Junior Piana, to connect him with people who were willing to spend less and achieve economical, efficient production.

        <section class="space" id="about">
            <h2>WE ARE LW</h2>
            <p class="paragrafos">
                We are here to reduce the water consumption used for agricultural and poultry purposes through monitoring technology and water exhaust adjustment. We are committed to doing our best to minimize water consumption and increase productivity.
            </p>
            <p class="paragrafos">
                Our application is based on the C language to manage temperature, water adjustment, and flow in the environment. It also includes an alert system to notify if there are any improvements or adjustments needed. HTML is used to display real-time updates on the dashboard, allowing professionals to monitor water consumption and make manual adjustments or improvements if necessary.
            </p>
            <p class="paragrafos">
                The hardware used for monitoring is housed within a waterproof enclosure that can withstand various weather conditions, including rainy days or extremely hot days.
